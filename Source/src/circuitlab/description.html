<h2>A benchmark for Petit Poucet</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liflab/petitpoucet">Petit Poucet</a> is Java
library that allows users to create function circuits over which
<em>lineage queries</em> can then be addressed.</p>

<p>This benchmark measures the impact on performance (processing time and
memory) of the lineage features. It does so by evaluating various function
circuits on multiple types of inputs.</p>

<h3>Set of problems</h3>

<p>The problems correspond to simple-to-medium computing tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Window average</em>: given a CSV file, this task extracts the numerical value
in each line, compute the average of each set of n successive values and check
that it is below some threshold <i>t</i></li>

<li><em>Sum of triangle areas</em>: given a list of arbitrary vectors, this task checks that each vector
contains the lengths of the three sides of a valid triangle; if so, it computes their
area using Heron’s formula 6 and sums the area of all valid triangles.</li>

<li><em>Nested bounding boxes</em>: given a DOM tree, this task checks that each element
has a bounding box (width and height) larger than all of its children.</li>

<li><em>Get all numbers</em>: represents a simple operation that takes an input comma-
separated list of elements, and produces a vector containing only the elements of
the file that are numerical values. The explanation we ask is to point at a given
element of the output vector, and retrace the location in the input string that
corresponds to this number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these problems comes in configurable "sizes"; for example, Window average
varies the number of elements in the input file, while Nested bounding boxes varies
the number of nodes in the DOM tree.</p>
