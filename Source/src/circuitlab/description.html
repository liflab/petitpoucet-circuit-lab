<h2>A benchmark for Petit Poucet</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liflab/petitpoucet">Petit Poucet</a> is Java
library that allows users to create function circuits over which
<em>lineage queries</em> can then be addressed.</p>

<p>This benchmark measures the impact on performance (processing time and
memory) of the lineage features. It does so by evaluating various function
circuits on multiple types of inputs, and comparing time and memory with
lineage being toggled on or off. Note that for historical reasons, this
benchmark uses the branch 1.x of Petit Poucet; since the benchmark was created,
a new version 2.x has been implemented; it provides similar features but with
a completely different API.</p>

<h3>Set of problems</h3>

<p>The problems correspond to simple-to-medium load computing tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Window average</em>: given a CSV file, this task extracts the numerical value
in each line, compute the average of each set of n successive values and check
that it is below some threshold <i>t</i></li>

<li><em>Iterator</em>: evaluates a temporal logic expression over a sequence o
method calls. The property stipulates that on a Java \texttt{Iterator}, every
call to method <tt>next</tt> must be followed by a call to <tt>hasNext</tt>. A
function circuit returning the <em>false</em> verdict can be explained by
retracing the locations in the sequence where two successive <tt>next</tt>
events can be found.</li>

<li><em>Count regex matches</em>: calculates the number of matches of a given
regular expression withing a character string. The explanation for the output
number retraces the character ranges of each sub-string matching the pattern in
question.</li>

<li><em>Sum of triangle areas</em>: given a list of arbitrary vectors, this task checks that each vector
contains the lengths of the three sides of a valid triangle; if so, it computes their
area using Heron’s formula 6 and sums the area of all valid triangles.</li>

<li><em>Nested bounding boxes</em>: given a DOM tree, this task checks that each element
has a bounding box (width and height) larger than all of its children.</li>

<li><em>Get all numbers</em>: represents a simple operation that takes an input comma-
separated list of elements, and produces a vector containing only the elements of
the file that are numerical values. The explanation we ask is to point at a given
element of the output vector, and retrace the location in the input string that
corresponds to this number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these problems comes in configurable "sizes"; for example, Window average
varies the number of elements in the input file, while Nested bounding boxes varies
the number of nodes in the DOM tree.</p>
